Description: BRIC-seq is a genome-wide approach for determining RNA stalibity in mammalian cells.
    bridger2 provides a series of functions for performing quality check of your BRIC-seq data,
    calculation of RNA half-life for each transcript and comparison of RNA half-lives between two conditions.
